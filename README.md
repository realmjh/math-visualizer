# math-visualizer
I wrote this piece of software in C++ so that I could visualize complex math equations more easily. This is by far the worst project I've done yet. 

Seriously, designing your own encryption is somehow more straightforward. All the functionality should be working. I'm not entirely sure, and I lack the sanity to test. 

Desmos is literally a thousand times better than this. However, if you like to look at the code, or just enjoy using things made in C++, please by all means use this piece of software. Otherwise, save yourself. 

# Usage
Download the .cpp file

Run this in your terminal/command prompt where the .cpp file is located:

`g++ -o math_visualizer math_visualizer.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lm`

Then do `./math-visualizer` to launch the application.

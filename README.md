# math-visualizer
I wrote this piece of software in C++ so that I coudl visualize complex math equations more easily. This is by far the worst project I've done yet. 

Seriously, designing your own encryption is somehow more straightforward. Some of the functionality is still busted asf. I'll fix it as time goes on. 

Desmos is literally a thousand times better than this. However, if you like to look at the code, or just enjoy using things made in C++, please by all means use this piece of software. Otherwise, save yourself. 

# Usage
Download the .cpp file. 
Run this in your terminal/command prompt where the .cpp file is located:
`g++ -o math_visualizer math_visualizer.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lm`
Then do `./math-visualizer` to launch the application.
